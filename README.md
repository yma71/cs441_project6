# IoT - SmartPark

This Android APP can record several information while the phone user is moving, such as  Accelerometer, Battery, Gps, Gyroscope,  Magnetometer. Firstly, it stores those data in local database, then uploads to online database (PhP MyAdmin) once it is connected to a Wifi network.

The idea was simple though, which is a typical IoT project. The biggest issue during development is to deal with several APP limits in Android OS, such as battery usage 'permit' or database access and r/w.
